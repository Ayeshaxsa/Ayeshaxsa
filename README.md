# Hi there, I'm Ayesha! 👋

I'm a curious and motivated **beginner developer** with hands-on experience in **Python, C, HTML, and CSS**. I'm especially passionate about **AI/ML**, and I'm currently expanding my skills to build smart and impactful applications.

- 🌱 Currently learning: ML concepts and foundational data science
- 🧠 Next up: ML frameworks (like Scikit-learn), Git/GitHub, and JavaScript
- 🛠️ Tools I use: VS Code, Git, Terminal, Replit
- 🎯 Goal: Build small AI-powered projects and deploy them on the web
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn best through memes and tiny chaotic side-projects 😄
